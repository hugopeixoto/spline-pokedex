virtually everything is ripped straight from the game's innards so you can be
sure it's accurate** and everything is presented very prettily.""") | n}</p>

game enough when we get there.""")}</p>

was a joint effort between me and Eifie; if anything, she did more than I did.
I somehow forgot to mention that when Conquest stuff first went live.""")}</p>
