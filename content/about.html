<p>Hey, this is a Pok√©dex.  If you don't know what that means, you're probably in the wrong place!</p>

<p>veekun's main claim to fame is that it's full of tools for <a href="${url(controller='dex', action='pokemon', name='eevee')}">displaying</a> and <a href="/dex/pokemon/compare">examining</a> data.  We've been working on it for <a href="${url('/dex/history')}">some time now</a>, though development waxes and wanes.  We're a pretty small team and we're all juggling a lot of other stuff, alas.</p>

<p>The name "veekun", doesn't mean anything in particular.  I always write it in lowercase, but almost everyone else capitalizes it.</p>

<p>I (the primary developer) am Eevee, and you can find out all about me on my <a href="https://eev.ee/">personal site</a>.  But I <a href="${url('/props')}">couldn't have done this alone</a>.</p>
